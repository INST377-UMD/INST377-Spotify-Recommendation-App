# Spotify Recommendation App
Created by: Abdullah Khan, Bryce Benedick, and Jacob Edelin

The Spotify Recommendation App allows users to select between a Track, Artist, or Album, then input a search for the respective category. The app will then generate a table of recommendations similar to the user's input. Users can also access their search history.

The Spotify API is being used to accomplish this.
