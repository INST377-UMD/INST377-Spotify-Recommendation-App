This is the README for the project.

To get the app to work, node, express, and body parser need to be installed
(commands to install these are in the node/express lecture but I'll add them later)

to run the server type the command: 
node app.js

you should get a message that states the app is running

then navigate to localhost:4000 and the server should be running
